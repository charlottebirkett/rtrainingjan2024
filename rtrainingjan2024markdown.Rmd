#Report 1: Why I deserve a hot chocolate, even though I have already had one this morning

Sometimes in life you have a hot chocolate in the morning, and then by the afternoon you want another one. 
You may ask yourself, can I do that? Is that allowed? 

We rarely ask the same of coffee or tea; I've had a cup of tea this morning too but I wouldn't think twice about having a second one.

Why then, do I question whether I can have a second hot chocolate? 

Let us examine the evidence. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Happiness vs No. of Hot Chocs"}
myhappiness<-seq(50,2,length=100)
numberofhotchocolates<-seq(50,2,length=100)
plot(myhappiness, numberofhotchocolates)

```

As the above graph shows, my happiness in life will exponentially increase as the number of hot chocolates consumed increases. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Sadness vs Time Since Last Hot Choc"}
unendingsadness<-seq(10,0, length=100)
timesincelasthotchocolates<-seq(10,0, length=100)
plot(unendingsadness, timesincelasthotchocolates)

```

However, as time since my last hot chocolate increases, so too does unending sadness. 

In conclusion, I deserve more hot chocolate, and will be going to buy one imminently. Here is a map of all the places I would buy a hot chocolate if I went on a round the world trip. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="All the places in the world I would buy hot chocolate"}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)

world1 <- map_data("world")
data <- world.cities
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = world1, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group), fill="grey", alpha=0.4) +
  geom_point( data=data, aes(x=long, y=lat)) +
  theme_void() + coord_map() 
```
