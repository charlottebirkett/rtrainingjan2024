#Report 1: Why I deserve a hot chocolate, even though I have already had one this morning

Sometimes in life you have a hot chocolate in the morning, and then by the afternoon you want another one. 
You may ask yourself, can I do that? Is that allowed? 

We rarely ask the same of coffee or tea; I've had a cup of tea this morning too but I wouldn't think twice about having a second one.

Why then, do I question whether I can have a second hot chocolate? 

Let us examine the evidence. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Happiness vs No. of Hot Chocs"}
myhappiness<-seq(50,2,length=100)
numberofhotchocolates<-seq(50,2,length=100)
plot(myhappiness, numberofhotchocolates)

```

As the above graph shows, my happiness in life will exponentially increase as the number of hot chocolates consumed increases. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Sadness vs Time Since Last Hot Choc"}
undendingsadness<-seq(0,10, length=100)
timesincelasthotchocolates<-seq(0,100, length=100)
plot(unendingsadness, timesincelasthotchocolates)

```

In conclusion, I deserve more hot chocolate.
